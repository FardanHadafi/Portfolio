# Personal Portfolio Website

A personal fullstack web developer portfolio built to showcase my projects,
technical skills, and approach to building modern, high-performance web applications.

This site is intentionally simple, fast, and framework-light — focused on
clean architecture, predictable state, and semantic HTML.
